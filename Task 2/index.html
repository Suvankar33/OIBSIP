                1931 to a poor Tamil Muslim family. He lived with his family in the temple city of Tamilnadu,
                Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an imam of a local mosque. At the same
                time, his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and one sister in his family.Kalam
                joined as a scientist in the aeronautical development establishment of DRDO in 1960, after graduation.
                His career started with him designing a small hovercraft. However, he was not convinced by his choice of

                Democratic Alliances’ nominated him to be president and it was supported by Samajwadi Party and National
                Congress Party. He was lovingly called as peoples’ president as he had done uncountable works for the
                welfare of the people and through the entire country.
            </p>

                of millions of people because of their contribution to the county. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was one such
                personality who died at 83. It was shocking news for the entire country as a pure soul left us forever.
                Abdul Kalam while delivering a speech for the youth in an event at IIM Shillong. During the middle of
                the speech, he suffered from a cardiac arrest and collapsed. Although he got admitted to the best
                hospital in Shillong, the doctors could not save him. </p>
